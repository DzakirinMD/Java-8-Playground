/**
 * A queue is a linear data structure or a collection in Java that stores elements in a FIFO (First In, First Out) order.
 * This means that the element is inserted in the queue at the end and removed from the queue at the beginning.
 * <p>
 * The Deque is a queue that supports insertion and deletion from both the ends.
 * The deque is thread-safe.
 *
 * Managing requests: When requests are submitted to a system, they can be stored in a Queue and processed in the order they
 * were received. This ensures that each request is handled fairly and that none are missed or skipped.
 *
 * Message processing: In messaging systems, messages can be added to a Queue and processed by different parts of the system
 * in a coordinated manner. For example, a Queue can be used to manage incoming messages to a chat application, ensuring that
 * each message is delivered to the intended recipient in the correct order.
 *
 * Event processing: In systems that handle events, such as notifications or alerts, a Queue can be used to manage the events
 * and ensure that they are processed in the correct order. This can be especially useful when events occur at a high rate
 * and need to be handled efficiently.
